    <h2>INGREDIENTS:</h2>
    <li>1 bunch leafy greens (spinach, mustard greens, or a mix)</li>
    <li>1 cup green beans, trimmed and halved</li>
    <li>2 medium potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
    <li>1 medium carrot, chopped (optional)</li>
    <li>4-5 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 inch ginger, grated</li>
    <li>2-3 green chilies, slit (adjust to taste)</li>
    <li>1 tbsp fermented soybean paste (Akhuni) or miso paste/a pinch of baking soda</li>
    <li>1 small bunch of fresh coriander leaves, chopped (or a few basil leaves as a substitute for Lengmaser)</li>
    <li>2 cups water (or more as needed)</li>
    <li>Salt to taste</li>
    <li>Cooked rice, for serving</li>
</ul>
<h2>STEPS:</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Prepare the vegetables:</strong>Wash all the vegetables thoroughly. Chop the leafy greens roughly.</li>
    <li><strong>Combine ingredients:</strong>In a medium-sized pot, combine the potatoes, carrots (if using), green beans, garlic, ginger, green chilies, and fermented soybean paste (or substitute). Add the water and bring to a boil.</li>
    <li><strong>Cook the vegetables:</strong>Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover the pot, and let the vegetables simmer until they are almost tender, about 15-20 minutes.</li>
    <li><strong>Add leafy greens:</strong>Add the chopped leafy greens to the pot and cook until they wilt, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li><strong>Season and finish:</strong>Season with salt to taste. Add the chopped coriander leaves (or basil). Stir well and cook for another minute.</li>
    <li><strong>Serve:</strong>Serve the Mizo Bai hot with cooked rice.</li>
</ol>
<h2>TYPES AND VARIATIONS:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>You can add other vegetables like cauliflower florets, eggplant, or pumpkin.</li>
    <li>Adjust the amount of chili peppers to your preference.</li>
    <li>If you don't have fermented soybean paste, miso paste or a pinch of baking soda will add a similar umami flavor.</li>
    <li>If you like a richer flavor, you can add a small piece of pork or a spoonful of Mizo cheese (fermented pork product) while the vegetables are cooking.</li>
    <li>Don't overcook the vegetables; they should retain some texture.</li>
    <li>This recipe is a basic version, and you can adapt it to your liking.</li>
</ul>
