    <h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2>
    <p>Chiroti is a delectable Indian dessert that is particularly popular in the states of Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Telangana. It is a layered pastry that is deep-fried until golden brown and crispy. The layers are created by rolling out thin sheets of dough and then layering them with a mixture of ghee and rice flour. The pastry is then rolled up tightly and cut into small pieces, which are then rolled out again and fried.</p>
    <p>Once the chiroti is fried, it is typically sprinkled with powdered sugar and sometimes garnished with chopped nuts like almonds or cashews. In some regions, it is also served with a side of sweetened milk. Chiroti is a popular treat during festivals and special occasions like weddings. Its crispy texture and sweet flavor make it a favorite among people of all ages.</p>

    <li><strong>For the Layering:</strong><ul>

    <li>1/4 cup rice flour</li>
    </ul><li><strong>For Dusting/Syrup:</strong> <ul>
        <li>Powdered sugar, for dusting</li>
        <li>OR</li>
        <li>1 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>Pinch of cardamom powder (optional)</li></ul></li>
<li>Oil, for deep frying</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong>In a bowl, combine all-purpose flour, semolina, melted ghee, and salt. Mix well. Gradually add water and knead to form a smooth, soft dough. Cover and let it rest for at least 30 minutes.</li>        
        <li><strong>Make the Layering Paste:</strong>In a separate bowl, mix melted ghee and rice flour to form a smooth paste.</li>
        <li><strong>Roll out the Dough:</strong>Divide the dough into equal portions. Roll each portion into a thin circle.</li>
        <li><strong>Layer the Dough:</strong>Take one rolled circle and spread the ghee-rice flour paste evenly over it. Place another rolled circle on top of the first one. Repeat this process, layering each circle with the paste, until you have a stack of 5-6 circles.</li>
        <li><strong>Roll and Cut: </strong>Tightly roll the layered dough into a cylindrical shape. Cut the cylinder into 1-inch pieces.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the Chiroti:</strong>Gently flatten each piece and roll it out into a small, thin circle.</li>
        <li><strong>Fry the Chiroti:</strong>Heat oil in a deep pan or kadai. Carefully add the chiroti and fry them over medium heat until they are golden brown and crispy on both sides.</li>
        <li><strong>Dust with Sugar or Dip in Syrup:</strong>Remove the fried chiroti and drain them on a paper towel. While they are still warm, either dust them generously with powdered sugar or dip them in a sugar syrup made by boiling sugar and water until a single thread consistency is reached. Add cardamom powder (if using) to the syrup.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong>Let the sugar-dusted or syrup-dipped chiroti cool completely before serving.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Enjoy your crispy and delicious homemade Chiroti!</p>
