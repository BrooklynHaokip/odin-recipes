    <h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2>
    <p>Chiroti is a delectable Indian dessert that is particularly popular in the states of Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Telangana. It is a layered pastry that is deep-fried until golden brown and crispy. The layers are created by rolling out thin sheets of dough and then layering them with a mixture of ghee and rice flour. The pastry is then rolled up tightly and cut into small pieces, which are then rolled out again and fried.</p>
    <p>Once the chiroti is fried, it is typically sprinkled with powdered sugar and sometimes garnished with chopped nuts like almonds or cashews. In some regions, it is also served with a side of sweetened milk. Chiroti is a popular treat during festivals and special occasions like weddings. Its crispy texture and sweet flavor make it a favorite among people of all ages.</p>
